This project focuses on developing a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health data. By analyzing features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and 
heart rate, the logistic regression algorithm classifies patients into high-risk or low-risk categories for heart disease. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to create an accurate
and interpretable prediction tool. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
